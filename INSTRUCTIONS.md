# Problems
## IntegerCalc.java
*   **Problem:** Write a Java program that declares two integer variables, num1 and num2, and assigns them values of 11 and 5 respectively (already done for you). Calculate the sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder of these two numbers and print the results.

*   **Hints:** Use the `+`, `-`, `\*`, `/`, and `//` operators for the arithmetic operations.


## DoubleDiscount.java
*   **Problem:** Write a Java program that declares two variables, price and discount, and assigns them values of 25.99 and 0.15 respectively. Calculate the discounted price and print it, following the expected output below.

*   **Expected Output:** The sale price is $_____.

*   **Hints:** Make sure to use the correct data type for decimal numbers. Use string concatenaton (+) with the variable to print the result.


## Grade.java
*   **Problem:** Write a Java program that declares a character variable named grade and assigns it the value 'A'. Print "Your grade is ", followed by the character variable.

*   **Expected Output:** Your grade is A.


## WeatherCheck.java
*   **Problem:** Write a Java program that declares two boolean variables, isRaining and isSunny, and assigns them values of true and false respectively. Print whether it is both raining and sunny.
*   **Expected outputs:** true or false
*   **Hints:** Use the AND operator (&&) to check if both conditions are true.


## Area.java
*   **Problem:** Write a program that declares variables width = 2.5 and height = 3.2. Calculate the area of the corresponding rectangle using the variables. Make sure that your program's output changes as expected when you change the variables.
*   **Expected output:** The area of a __ by __ rectangle is __.

## EonsCalc.java
*   **Problem:** Create two numerical variables: ageOfUniverse (with the age of the universe in years) and yearsSinceDinosaurs (with the number of years since the dinosaurs went extinct). Calculate how many years old the universe was when the dinosaurs went extinct and print the result.
*   **Expected output:** The universe was __ years old when the dinosaurs went extinct.
*   **Hints:** Make sure to use the appropriate data type for large integers.

## Circle.java
*   **Problem:** Write a Java program that declares a variable radius and assigns it a value of your choice. Calculate the area and circumference of a circle with that radius and print the results.
*   **Expected output:** The area of a circle with radius __ is __ and the circumference is __.
*   **Hints:** Use the Math.PI constant for the value of pi.

## Quadratic.java
*   **Problem:** Write a Java program that declares variables a, b, and c with values of your choice, and outputs the two possible results x of the quadratic formula.
*   **Hints:** Use Math.sqrt() for the square root and Math.pow() for the power.

## EveryOther.java
*   **Problem:** Declare five boolean variables: isWorkingMonday, isWorkingTuesday, isWorkingWednesday, isWorkingThursday, and isWorkingFriday. If you are working every other day of the week (ie Monday, Wednesday, and Friday OR Tuesday and Thursday), print true. Otherwise, print false.
*   **Hints:** Use AND (||) and OR (&&) along with parentheses to group the conditions correctly.
